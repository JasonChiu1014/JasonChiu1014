### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a  student in Taipei Xisong High school.
In order to make people's lives better, I started to code.
I'm not a pro, but I really enjoy to build something.

ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on a project as a leader to create a roll call website for my class.
 
ðŸŒ± I'm learning how to "prompt" and smash all the things together to build my own Quasimodo, lol.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any projects that can offer me opportunity to participate anyting.

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with understanding a full process of building a website.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my opinion about your stories, I'm trying to be friendly and easygoing person.

ðŸ“« Reach me by my email: jasonchiu1014@gmail.com or my instagram: jasonchiu.zip.

ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: Call me Jason is fine.

âš¡ Fun fact: I think I got ADHD....sdfhwuiefwiuhfiuwbfuiwefbiuewbfuwiebfwiuebf
